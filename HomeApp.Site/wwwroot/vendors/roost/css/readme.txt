IMPORTANT!!!

- All files in CSS directory are auto generated using a Grunt task.
- Do not edit any files in CSS directory directly.
- If you want to edit any styles, edit the LESS files.
- Master CSS file (app.css) is splitted in to 2 parts (app_1.min and app_2.min) in order to give support for IE9.
- Make sure to run 'grunt watch' task before you make any changes in any LESS files.
